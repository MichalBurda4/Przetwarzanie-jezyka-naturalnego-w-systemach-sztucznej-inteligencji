A long time ago, there lived a wise old man who knew many things. He would often tell stories to the children in the village. They would gather around him and listen carefully.

One evening, a storm approached, and the children were scared. The old man reassured them and said, "Do not fear the storm; it brings rain, and rain is essential for life."

After the storm passed, the village was transformed. The plants looked greener, and the air was fresh. The children played outside, happy to see the sun shining again.

Years later, they remembered the old man's words and understood the importance of nature. They promised to take care of their environment for future generations.

In a small village, people lived peacefully. They worked hard and supported one another. Every morning, they would gather to discuss the day's tasks.

One day, a stranger came to town. He claimed he could teach them how to improve their crops. The villagers were curious and decided to listen. They asked many questions and learned a lot from him.

As the seasons changed, the villagers applied the new techniques. They saw incredible results and their harvests grew larger. They felt grateful for the stranger's visit and invited him to stay.

After some time, the stranger said it was time for him to leave. The villagers understood but were sad to see him go. They promised to keep practicing what they learned.
